# Hi — I’m Shine Jose

**Data Scientist • Machine Learning Engineer • Time-Series Forecasting**

I build production-ready forecasting solutions and interactive analytics that turn noisy time-series into actionable insight. I focus on robust model evaluation, explainability, and end-to-end delivery — from data pipeline to dashboard.

**📍 Darmstadt · Open to collaborations, contract roles, and data projects**

## Selected projects
> Each project repository includes a short summary, reproducible notebooks or scripts, and a demo or visual output where applicable.

### [Energy-Forecasting](https://github.com/shinejose0007/energy-forecasting)  
End-to-end energy demand forecasting pipeline: data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, backtesting, and a Streamlit demo. (Key metrics: RMSE = *X*, forecasting horizon = *Y*.)

### [Load-Forecasting-models](https://github.com/shinejose0007/load-forecasting-models)  
Systematic comparison of ARIMA, Prophet and LSTM approaches with cross-validation, error analysis, and reproducible notebooks.

### [Eda-Dashboards](https://github.com/shinejose0007/eda-dashboards)  
Interactive exploratory dashboards (Plotly + Streamlit) demonstrating feature importance, seasonality, and anomaly detection workflows.

*(Tip: pin these repositories to your profile so they appear prominently.)*

## How I work
- I structure projects for reproducibility: clear README, requirements, and runnable examples (notebooks / scripts / Docker).  
- I prioritize clear metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) and visualize model performance vs. baseline.  
- I document assumptions, dataset provenance, and evaluation approach for every analysis.

---

## Collaboration & contributions
- I welcome contributions and constructive feedback. Repositories include CONTRIBUTING guidelines and labels for `good first issue` / `help wanted` where appropriate.  
- If you would like to collaborate on forecasting challenges, dashboards, or production ML pipelines, please reach out.
